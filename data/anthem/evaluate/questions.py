        "query": "What is covered in my insurance claims?",
        "answer": "Your insurance claims will cover ambulance services in the following three circumstances: Ambulance response was requested because of an emergency, and the member was transported to a hospital; Ambulance response was requested because of an emergency, but no transportation was provided; and Ambulance transportation from a hospital or skilled nursing facility (SNF) to another facility for diagnostic or therapeutic services that is not available in the admitting hospital or skilled nursing facility. In addition, Medicaid plans will provide coverage for ambulance services according to the contract provisions, such as local emergency transportation provided that it is to the nearest hospital that can provide the required care and treatment, furnished by a professional ambulance service, and certified by a doctor that it was necessary. When ambulance transportation is covered by the terms of a contract, even though ground, water, or air transportation may not be specifically mentioned, any of these types of transportation will be covered. The benefit available for ambulance services is determined by the contract."

        "query": "I live in Colorado. Are there any special rules that apply when I submit an ambulance claim?",
        "answer": "Yes, there are special rules that apply when submitting an ambulance claim in Colorado. All plans/products in Colorado/Nevada will process all out-of-network air and ground ambulance claims at the in-network benefit level and allow the claim at billed charges (subject to Medical Necessity guidelines). Claims may still be sent for NCN edit, once all other edits are resolved. Participating ambulance claims are allowed at the providerâ€™s contractual rates. Additionally, as of 1/1/2022 Air Ambulances are no longer allowed to balance bill."

        "query": "When is a patient considered to be in emergency medical condition?",
        "answer": "A patient is considered to be in an emergency medical condition when they are experiencing acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, severe dysfunction of any bodily organ or part, or serious disfigurement."

        "query": "Hi I would like to know if ambulance services are covered in my insurance",
        "answer": "Yes, ambulance services are covered in your insurance. Benefits will be provided from the scene of a life-threatening accident or emergency to the nearest appropriate hospital with bed availability. Ambulance services to a more distant hospital, solely to avail a patient of the service of a specific physician or physician specialist, do not qualify for benefits. Benefits will also be provided for ambulance services from an acute care hospital to a patient's home when any other method of transportation is contraindicated. Benefits will also be provided for ambulance services to or from a Skilled Nursing Facility or Free-Standing Dialysis Center. These services will not require Medical Review intervention."

        "query": "Medicare in my primary insurance provider, so how would that work?",
        "answer": "If Medicare is your primary insurance provider, NewCo policies do not apply. However, if Medicare has allowed ambulance services that would have been denied by NewCo as included in the base rate and mileage allowances (in the absence of Medicare), NewCo should follow Medicare's payment logic and consider those services for payment on the NewCo secondary claim."
